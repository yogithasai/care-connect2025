## 🚀 Problem Statement

Healthcare today is:
- Fragmented – patient records are scattered across hospitals, labs, and clinics
- Reactive – treatment often starts late due to delayed diagnosis
- Inaccessible – rural patients struggle to reach specialists
- Overwhelming – doctors face information overload and manual follow-up tasks

## 💡 Solution

MediLink 2.0 solves these challenges by acting as a **single intelligent healthcare assistant**:
- **Unifies patient data** from multiple sources (EHRs, labs, IoT devices)
- **AI-powered chatbot** to explain reports, answer health questions, and remind patients
- **Predictive analytics** to detect early risks of chronic diseases
- **n8n automation workflows** to trigger alerts, schedule follow-ups, and notify doctors
- **Telemedicine module** for video consultations
- **Voice-first interface** for accessibility (local language + caregiver mode)
